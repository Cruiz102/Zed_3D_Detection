# Zed_3D_Detection
A Custom Ros node for getting the data from the Zed Camera and calculate the 3d objects positions.



Used the following [repository](https://github.com/carlos-argueta/pc_experiments/blob/main/2DBoxto3DFrustum/2DBoxto3DFrustum.py) algorithm for filtering the point clouds given a bounding box.

The code is expected to use CUDA for computing the math.
